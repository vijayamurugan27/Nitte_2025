Circular Singly Linked List Program - Detailed Explanation

This program implements a Circular Singly Linked List in C, where the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. 
Below is a structured breakdown of the code:

    1. Node Structure

                struct Node {
                    int data;           // Stores the integer value
                    struct Node *next;  // Pointer to the next node
                };

                Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node's next points back to the first node.

    2. Global Variables

            struct Node *tail = NULL;  // Points to the last node (tail->next is the head)

                    tail is used instead of head for easier insertion at the end.
                    tail->next always points to the first node (head).


    
    3. Core Functions

        1. create() - Creates a Circular Linked List

            Takes user input for the number of nodes and their data.

            Dynamically allocates memory for each node.

            Links the last node back to the first, forming a circle.


        2. display() - Prints the Linked List

            Traverses from tail->next (head) until it circles back.

            Prints each node's data.


        3. Insertion Operations

            Function	    Description
            insertAtBeg()	Inserts a node at the beginning.
            insertAtEnd()	Inserts a node at the end.
            insertAtPos()	Inserts a node at a given position.
            insert_after()	Inserts a node after a given value.
            insert_before()	Inserts a node before a given value.

        4. Deletion Operations

            Function	    Description
            delAtBeg()	    Deletes the first node.
            delAtEnd()	    Deletes the last node.
            delAtPos()	    Deletes a node at a given position.
            delete_after()	Deletes a node after a given value.
            delete_before()	Deletes a node before a given value.

        5. Update Operations

            Function	    Description
            updateAtPos()	Updates a node at a given position.
            update_before()	Updates a node before a given value.
            update_after()	Updates a node after a given value.

        6. Utility Functions
            Function	    Description
            search()	    Searches for a value in the list.
            get_length()	Returns the number of nodes.
            reverse()	    Reverses the linked list.


    4. Main Function (Menu-Driven Program)

        Presents a menu with 19 operations.

        Uses switch-case to execute the chosen function.

        Runs in an infinite loop (while(1)) until the user exits.


    5. Key Observations

        Circular Structure

            The last node's next points back to the first node.

            No NULL pointers (except when the list is empty).

        Efficient Insertions/Deletions at Ends

            tail allows O(1) insertion/deletion at both ends.

        Traversal

            Must check for temp != tail->next to avoid infinite loops.

        Edge Cases

            Empty list (tail == NULL).

            Single-node list (tail->next == tail).



    6. Example Execution
    Input:

        Create a list: 3 → 1 → 4 → 2 (circular)

        Insert at beginning: 5 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 2 (circular)

        Delete at position 3: 5 → 3 → 4 → 2 (circular)

        Display: 5 3 4 2 (repeats infinitely if not stopped)

        
    Output:
        
        5 3 4 2


    7. Comparison with Singly Linked List:

    Feature	            Singly Linked List	                Circular Singly Linked List
    Structure	        Ends with NULL	                    Ends with Last node points to first
    Traversal	        Stops at NULL	                    Must check for tail->next
    Memory Overhead	    Same	                            Same
    Insertion at End	O(n) (unless tail is maintained)	O(1) (with tail pointer)
