// Working with Specific Memory Addresses

// While directly accessing specific memory addresses is uncommon in user-space programs (and often unsafe), it can be done:



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned long long address = 0x0000002A7EFFFA9C;
    unsigned int address_32bit = (unsigned int)address;

    printf("64-bit address: 0x%016llX\n", address);
    printf("32-bit address: 0x%08X\n", address_32bit);

    return 0;
}
